Where  they  vary  in  specific  functionality,  they  align  in approach. Both platforms, backed by Apollo, can be deployed in almost any environment.\\n\\nSimilarly, customers can now use Apollo to enable continuous deployment, configuration management, and central software operations management across almost any environment for their own software products.\\n\\n## Gotham\\n\\nGotham  enables  users  to  identify  patterns  hidden  deep  within  datasets,  ranging  from  signals  intelligence  sources  to  reports  from  confidential  informants.  It  also facilitates the hand-off between analysts and operational users, helping operators plan and execute real-world responses to threats that have been identified within the platform. Gotham is now used broadly across government functions.\\n\\nWe also offer Gotham to our commercial customers, including to those in the financial services industry in connection with fraud investigations.\\n\\n## Foundry\\n\\nFoundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data. Individual users can integrate and analyze the data they need in one place. The speed with which users can experiment and test new ideas is what makes the software stick.\\n\\nData projects often fail because the steps and methods used to build data pipelines are difficult to understand and recreate. We built Foundry's backend to solve the root of this problem. The platform's graphical interface does the rest, allowing users to track and trace their pipelines so they know what the rows and columns in their tables represent and why they are there. All of our commercial customers now use it, as do several of our government customers.\\n\\n## Apollo\\n\\nWe have always prioritized meeting our customers wherever they need us most. We originally built Apollo to enable the continuous delivery of our software wherever our customers are: in the cloud, on-premises, or even more rugged environments. Today, Apollo enables the rapid, secure delivery of our software and updates across our business.\\n\\nIn 2021, we began offering Apollo as a commercial solution to allow our customers to securely deploy their own software in virtually any environment. Apollo provides a single control layer to coordinate ongoing delivery of new features, security updates, and platform configurations.\\n\\n## Our Customers\\n\\nWe work with many of the world's leading government and commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2022, we had 367 customers.\\n\\nAn overview of those customers and the ways in which they use our software follows below.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nOur software is currently used across more than 60 industries around the world.\\n\\nOf the $1.9 billion in revenue that we generated in 2022, 56% came from customers in the government segment, and 44% came from customers in the commercial segment.\\n\\nOur business continues to have a global presence. In 2022, we earned 61% of our revenue from customers in the United States, and 39% from those abroad.\\n\\nThe average revenue for our top twenty customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $49.4 million, and is up from 2021, when the average revenue from our top 20 customers during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was $43.6 million, demonstrating our expanding relationships with existing customers.\\n\\n## Our Software at Work\\n\\nOur software is in the hands of factory workers, soldiers, clinicians, prosecutors, investigators, claims adjusters, technicians, intelligence analysts, and social workers around  the  world.  It  is  used  in  a  variety  of  applications  including  by  utility  operations  analysts,  automotive  manufacturing  workers,  oil  and  gas  technicians  and operators, and pharmaceutical researchers in the United States; supply-chain managers in South Korea; assembly workers in France; public health administrators in the United Kingdom and the United States; and special forces personnel and military officials in the United States and abroad.\\n\\n## Industries and Sectors\\n\\nIn addition to supporting individual institutions, our platforms have become central operating systems for entire industries and sectors.\\n\\nOur work with Airbus S.A.S. ('Airbus'), for example, was initially focused on the production of the A350 aircraft. The deployment of our software soon grew into Skywise, our aviation platform that has become the central operating system of the airline industry.\\n\\nSkywise connects more than 10,000 aircraft across a growing community of airlines, maintenance and repair organizations, authorities, and Airbus. Decision makers at each of these institutions use Skywise to more efficiently design, manufacture, service, operate, and maintain their global fleets.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=19049, end_char_idx=24044, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.8237512832146352)]"
